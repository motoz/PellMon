# Enable the ScotteCom plugin to communicate with a NBE scotty/woody/biocomfort pellet burner
# Disable this when using the PelletCalc plugin
p01 = ScotteCom

# PelletCalc replaces ScotteCom when using a generic pellet burner.
# It provides the necessary feeder_time and feeder_capacity data items
# calculated from auger run time measurements or auger revoulution counting
#p07 = PelletCalc

# CustomAlarms lets you define limits and actions for data items
#p02 = CustomAlarms

# RaspberryGPIO provides IO, counters, timers and a tachometer. Works only on a raspberry pi
#p03 = RaspberryGPIO

# The calculate plugin is a scripting engine that lets you do calculations and automate things
#p04 = Calculate

# The OWFS plugin connects to a local or remote owserver to read/write onewire devices
#p05 = OWFS

# The SiloLevel plugin adds parameters for silo fill up level and silo fill up date.
# When enabled PellmonWeb displays a graph with calculated silo level from fill up time 
# to present time
p06 = SiloLevel

# PelletCalc calculates feeder_time and power from feeder auger revolution count  
#p07 = PelletCalc

# Consumption calculates bar chart data to be used by the web interface

############################################################################################

[plugin_ScotteCom]
# The settings in this section are passed to the ScotteCom plugin

# Serial port device name, eg. /dev/ttyUSB0
# Remove to run with dummy data for testing
serialport = /dev/ttyUSB0

# Chip version string or 'auto'
chipversion = auto

[plugin_TestPlugin]
# Items in sections named as "plugin_xxx" are passed to a plugin named "xxx"
# This plugin adds the items listed as dummy parameters
plugindata1 = 123

[plugin_CustomAlarms]
# Define an alarm by creating four parameters:
# xxx_item = item to read
# xxx_comparator = >|>=|<|<=|==|!=
# xxx_level = level to compare against
# xxx_status = item to hold the result of the comparision, 1=True, 0=False
# optional:
# xxx_enum = FalseText|TrueText

# example: 
#alarm1_item = boiler_temp
#alarm1_comparator = >
#alarm1_level = 90
#alarm1_status = boiler_temp_supervision
#alarm1_enum = OK|Boiler temperature too high

[plugin_RaspberryGPIO]
# xxx_function = input|latched_input|output|counter|tachometer|timer, all inputs have the internal pullup activated
# xxx_item = item name for pin
# xxx_pin = board pin number
# A timer input counts seconds when it is in the active state. The timer can be reset by writing a new value to it
# The active state can be set with xxx_active = 1|0 (only for timer inputs)
#example:
#gpio22_function = counter
#gpio22_item = counter1
#gpio22_pin = 15


[plugin_Calculate]
# This plugin implements a simple stack engine. 
# xxx_prog = instruction|value instruction|value... A 'value' pushes the value to the stack, an 'instrucation' pops one or several values and pushes the result back to the stack.
# xxx_readitem = Name of readonly item that executes the calculation and return the top value of the stack when read
# xxx_writeitem = Name of writeonly item that executes the calculation when written. The written value is pushed to the stack so the program can make use of it.
# xxx_readwriteitem = Name of read/write item that executes the calculation when read or written. The written value is pushed to the stack so the program can make use of it, and the top value of the stack is returned when read.
# xxx_taskcycle = execute the calculation periodically with this cycle time in seconds
# xxx_progtype = R|R/W, default is R (read only). An R/W program item can be edited in the web frontend and can be used by other programs as a variable by using get/set

# Available instructions:
# +, -, *, /, get, set, exec, >, <, ==, !=, ?, min, max, pop, dup, swap, sp, def, sto, rcl, del, gdef, gsto, grcl, gdel, if..then..[else]..end
# 'get' pops an item name, reads the value and pushes the value or 'error'
# 'set' pops an item name and a value, then writes the value to the item name and pushes the result 'OK' or 'error'. ex: "1250 feeder_capacity set"
# ? pops three values, first the value to push back when False, then the value to push back when True, and then the value to evaluate. Ex: "0 123 456 ?" will leave "456" on the stack, while "1 123 456 ?" will leave "123" on the stack
# 'min' pops two values and pushes back the smallest
# 'max' pops two values and pushes back the laragest
# 'exec' pops a calculate item name, gets its value, executes it and pushes the result
# 'pop' discards one value from the stack
# 'dup' duplicates the top value on the stack
# 'swap' swaps the order of the two top values on the stack
# 'sp' pushes the current stack depth, eg zero when the stack is empty
# 'def' pops two values, the first becames the name of a new local variable and the second it's value. If the variable already exists it's value is not changed. 
# 'sto' pops two values, the first is the name of a local variable and the second a value to write to it
# 'rcl' pops one value which identifies a local variable to read and pushes it's value back to the stack
# 'del' pops one value which identifies a local variable to delete
# gdef, gsto, grcl, gdel works exactly as def, sto, rcl, del, except that they handle global variables that persist between program executions and are available to all programs.
# 'if' marks the start of an if..then..[else]..end clause. 'then' pops a value, if it is non-zero, execution is continued until 'else|end'. If 'else' is found execution skips forward until 'end' is found. If 'then' pops a zero from the stack, execution skips forward until 'else|end' is found and then resumes

# example: get boiler temperature divided by two from an item named 'half_boiler_temp'
#calc1_prog = boiler_temp get 2 /
#calc1_readitem = half_boiler_temp


[plugin_OWFS]
# xxx_item = item name for the owfs sensor value
# xxx_path = [server::]path[:port], default server:port is localhost:4304
# optional:
# when the type is set to COUNTER the owfs path is polled cyclically and the item incremented on every 0->1 transition
# xxx_type = R|R/W|COUNTER, default is R
# xxx_latch = path, make use of the latch when using a ds2406 as input/counter

# examples:
# read the temperature value from the fake sensor available in the default owfs configuration 
#owfs1_item = faketemp
#owfs1_path = 10.67C6697351FF/temperature

# use a ds2460 as counter with support for the input latch
# owfs2_item = ds2460count
# owfs2_path = uncached/12.8D3E7D000000/sensed.A
# owfs2_type = COUNTER
# owfs2_latch = uncached/12.8D3E7D000000/latch.A


[plugin_PelletCalc]
# Set one of these:
# counter = name of item to read feeder auger rev count from
# timer = name of item to read cumulative feeder run time in seconds from
